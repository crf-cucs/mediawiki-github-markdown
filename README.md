# GitHub Markdown on MediaWiki!?
This MediaWiki extension enables GitHub markdown on MediaWiki, using [https://github.com/erusev/parsedown](Parsedown) 
and MediaWiki's PreProcessor hook.

This extension is designed to make it easier for users to edit. While MediaWiki does have a robust Markdown language,
many people are more comfortable with the Markdown used on GitHub/StackOverflow. Keeping track of two different types of
Markdown can be annoying.

## Compatibility
This extension is compatible with MediaWiki style markdown. However, GitHub-style markdown will always take precedence
as it is parsed first.
